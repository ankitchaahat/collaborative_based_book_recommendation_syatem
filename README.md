# Step-by-Step Implementation

# 1. Import Required Libraries:

Import the necessary libraries, such as pandas and numpy.

# 2. Load Data from CSV Files:

Read data from CSV files (Books.csv, Users.csv, Ratings.csv) using pd.read_csv() and store them in DataFrames (books, users, ratings).

# 3. Handle Warnings Related to Mixed Data Types:

Address the DtypeWarning regarding mixed types in columns (if necessary by specifying dtype or low_memory=False).

# 4. Inspect the DataFrames:

Display the first few rows of each DataFrame using head() to understand the structure and content of the data.

# 5. Check DataFrame Shapes:

Use shape to determine the number of rows and columns in each DataFrame.

# 6. Identify Missing Values:

Use isnull().sum() to identify missing values in each DataFrame.


# 7 . Check for Duplicate Records:

Use duplicated().sum() to check if there are any duplicate records in the DataFrames.

# 8. Merge Ratings with Book Titles:

Merge ratings with books DataFrame on the ISBN column to get a DataFrame with book titles (ratings_with_name).

# 9. Calculate Number of Ratings per Book:

Group by Book-Title and count the number of ratings. Rename the column to num-ratings.

# 10. Convert 'Book-Rating' to Numeric:

Convert the Book-Rating column to numeric to handle non-numeric values (if any).

# 11. Calculate Average Ratings per Book:

Group by Book-Title and compute the mean rating. Rename the column to avg-ratings.

# 12. Merge DataFrames for Popularity:

Merge num_rating_df with avg_rating_df on Book-Title to create a DataFrame (popular_df) with both number of ratings and average ratings.

# 13. Filter Popular Books:

Filter books with at least 250 ratings and sort them by avg-ratings in descending order.

# 14. Merge with Books Data:

Merge popular_df with the original books DataFrame to get additional details like ISBN, Book-Author, etc.

# 15. Remove Duplicates Based on Book Title:

Remove duplicate entries based on the Book-Title column.


# 16. Finalize the Popular Books DataFrame:

Further refine popular_df to keep only relevant columns and ensure no duplicates.
