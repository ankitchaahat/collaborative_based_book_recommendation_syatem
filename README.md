# Step-by-Step Implementation

# 1. Import Required Libraries:

Import the necessary libraries, such as pandas and numpy.

# 2. Load Data from CSV Files:

Read data from CSV files (Books.csv, Users.csv, Ratings.csv) using pd.read_csv() and store them in DataFrames (books, users, ratings).

# 3. Check Dataset Shapes:

Print the shape of each dataset to confirm they have been loaded correctly.

# 4. Merge Datasets to Include Book Titles:

Merge ratings with books to include book titles and other relevant details.

# 5 . Calculate the Number of Ratings for Each Book:

Group by Book-Title and count the number of ratings for each book.

# 6. Convert Ratings to Numeric:

Convert the Book-Rating column to a numeric type to handle any non-numeric values.

# 7. Calculate Average Rating for Each Book:

Compute the average rating for each book.


# 8. Merge Average and Number of Ratings DataFrames:

Merge the dataframes containing the number of ratings and average ratings.


# 9 . Filter Books with Minimum Ratings:

Filter books with at least 250 ratings and sort by average rating.

# 10. Merge Additional Book Information:

Merge popular_df with books to include author names and image URLs, and remove duplicates.

# 11. Identify Active Users:

Group by User-ID to find users who have rated more than 200 books.

# 12. Filter Ratings for Active Users:

Filter the ratings to include only the ratings given by these active users.

# 13. Identify Frequently Rated Books:

Filter books that have been rated by at least 50 different users.

# 14. Create Final Ratings DataFrame:

Create a final ratings dataframe containing only the frequently rated books.

# 15. Create a Pivot Table:

Generate a pivot table for the final_ratings with Book-Title as rows, User-ID as columns, and Book-Rating as values. Fill missing values with 0.


# 16 . Compute Cosine Similarity:

Calculate cosine similarity between books based on user ratings.

# 17. Define Recommendation Function:

Implement a function to recommend books based on a given book's similarity score.

# 18 .Test the Recommendation Function:

Use the recommendation function to test for a specific book.


# 19 . Save Necessary Data to Files:

Serialize the popular books dataframe, pivot table, books dataframe, and similarity scores to files using the pickle module.

By following these steps, you create a book recommendation system using popularity-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques with cosine similarity.
